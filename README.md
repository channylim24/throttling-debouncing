# Throttling and Debouncing in React

This repository contains examples and implementations of throttling and debouncing techniques in React, aimed at optimizing performance in event-driven applications.

## 📚 Overview

In modern web development, managing event-driven functions is crucial for user experience and application performance. This project demonstrates how to effectively use throttling and debouncing to enhance React components, particularly in scenarios involving frequent events.

### 🔧 Throttling
Throttling limits the execution of a function to a specified interval. It's ideal for events that trigger frequently, such as scrolling or resizing.

### 🚦 Debouncing
Debouncing delays the execution of a function until after a specified period of inactivity. This is especially useful for inputs, such as search fields, where you want to wait until the user stops typing before performing an action.

## ⚙️ Examples

### 1. ThrottleComponent
- **Description:** A React component that demonstrates throttling with a scroll event.
- **Usage:** Check the `ThrottleComponent.jsx` file to see how throttling is implemented.

### 2. DebounceInput
- **Description:** A React component that demonstrates debouncing with an input field.
- **Usage:** Check the `DebounceInput.jsx` file to see how debouncing is implemented.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
